# mhc_table_sars.txt

A table of the number of times each peptide in SARS-CoV-2 containing a non-synonymous mutation can bind to common human MHC class I molecules. The first column represents the number of strong binding occurrences, the second column represents weak binding occurrences, the third column indicates the total number of times binding was detected, and the fourth column contains the virus accession number and mutation position, separated by “-”.

 

# mhc_table_h3n2.txt

A list of the number of times each peptide in H3N2 containing a non-synonymous mutation can bind to common human MHC class I molecules.

 

# COSMIC_SBS96_Activities.txt

The number of mutations in all ssRNA virus mutational spectra explained by COSMIC signatures.

 

# signatures_mSigHdp.txt

A set of 21 signatures extracted from all ssRNA virus mutational spectra using mSigHdp.

 

# all_signature_species.txt

Mutational signatures extracted from H3N2, H5N1, SARS-CoV-2, Mumps, Rabies, WNV, and Zika separately.

 

# all_signature_family.txt

Mutational signatures extracted from 13 viral families separately.

 

# sars_nosyn_spectrum.csv

The non-synonymous iSNV mutational spectrum for SARS-CoV-2.
